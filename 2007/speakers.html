<div class="session">
<h4>John Lam - RubyCLR and Ruby.NET</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="images/speakers/lam.jpg" width="67" height="100" align="left" />As 
dynamic languages gain popularity, it becomes more important to play well with 
others. There are a tremendous number of useful libraries that ship with the 
.NET platform that Ruby developers can use in their applications. RubyCLR is a 
bridge between the standard C-based implementation of the Ruby interpreter, and 
code that executes in the .NET Common Language Runtime. We will look at the 
design of RubyCLR to better understand how to implement a high-performance and 
high-fidelity interop layer between dynamic languages and statically typed 
libraries.</p>
<p>John Lam is a Program Manager on the Common Language Runtime team at 
Microsoft. He&#39;s the creator of RubyCLR, a high-performance bridge between Ruby 
and the .NET Common Language Runtime. He&#39;s bringing the love of Ruby out to the 
statically typed heathens at Microsoft and beyond.</p>

<div class="session">
<h4>Gregory Brown - Pragmatic Community Driven Development in Ruby</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="images/speakers/brown.jpg" width="200" height="193" align="left" />A talk about community driven software development and the tools, techniques, 
and practices necessary to build a successful free software project. The presentation 
will focus on how to get through the growing pains many Ruby projects inevitably 
experience, and help you put your project on the path to 1.0</p>
<p>Gregory Brown is the lead developer of Ruby Reports and an active member of the 
new_haven.rb and NYC.rb user groups.</p>
</div>

<div class="session">
<h4>Ara T. Howard - Ruby Queue</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="images/speakers/howard.jpg" width="200" height="184" align="left" />The 
Ruby Queue software package lowers the barriers scientists need to overcome in 
order to realize the power of Linux clusters. It provides an extremely simple, 
economic, and easy-to-understand tool that harnesses the power of many CPUs 
while simultaneously allowing researchers to shift their focus away from the 
mundane details of complicated distributed computing systems and back to the 
task of actually doing science. The toolset is designed with a K.I.S.S, research 
focused, philosophy that enables any ordinary (non-root) user to set up a 
zero-admin Linux cluster in 10 minutes or less. It is currently being used 
successfully in such diverse fields as bio-chemical research at the University 
of Toronto, geo-mechanical modeling at IGEOSS, and studying the nighttime lights 
of the world at the National Geophysical Data Center.</p>

<div class="session">
<h4>James Britt - Black-boxing with Ruby: Adding Ruby APIs and Front-ends to Existing Software</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="images/speakers/britt.jpg" width="200" height="169" align="left" />While it's tempting to want to rewrite everything into The One True language, 
often it is better to deal with these applications on their own terms, and use Ruby 
as an API proxy. This allows one to use Ruby for day-to-day interaction while avoiding 
the overhead of reinventing the wheel. My talk will use examples from some of my 
real-life projects created to allow the use of some best-of-class non-Ruby software 
while abstracting assorted interactions behind a handy set of Ruby tools and services.</p>
</div>

<div class="session">
<h4>Michael Hewner - Ruby USB</h4>
<p>One of the really neat things about USB devices is that they are almost entirely 
self-describing, which makes it easy to let Ruby just &quot;do the right thing&quot; when 
communicating with them. This presentation will give a brief introduction to the 
USB spec and then a discussion of the difficulties of integrating Ruby with this 
spec (and the libUsb library that wrapped it). Then there will be a tutorial about 
how to use RubyUSB to discover the interface of a random USB device and how to write 
short ruby scripts that do cool things with these USB devices.</p>
<p>Michael Hewner is currently applying to graduate school for his Ph.D. in Computer 
Science. Until recently he worked as a programmer for Amazon.com. He has a M.S. 
in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>

<div class="session">
<h4>Charles Oliver Nutter and Thomas Enebo - JRuby: Not Just Another Ruby Impl</h4>
<p>JRuby has made great progress over the past year, now supporting most of Ruby's 
libraries and capabilities as well as running mainstream apps like Rails and RSpec. 
The development team has grown to four core members and the JRuby community has 
15 or more regular contributors and dozens of users. The potential of a JVM-backed 
Ruby implementation has started to attract the attention of even hardcore Rubyists. 
JRuby has really arrived this year.</p>
<p>This session will talk about JRuby development progress over the last year, the 
current status of JRuby, and our plans for future JRuby internals and externals. 
We'll compare and contrast a bit with MRI, YARV, and other up-and-coming Ruby implementations. 
We'll talk about how we can all share the load and help raise Ruby up in all quarters. 
And most of all, we'll have lots of demos to show that JRuby is a real, viable Ruby 
platform you should consider while developing Ruby applications in the future.</p>

<div class="session">
<h4>Jeff Barczewski - MasterView</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="images/speakers/barczewski.jpg" width="160" height="200" align="left" />Tired of spending precious development time hand coding Ruby/Rails views? The 
MasterView template engine is a ruby gem (or rails plugin) that enables the 
creation of Ruby/Rails views in standards-compliant XHTML. MasterView makes the 
power and productivity of Ruby/Rails accessible to a wider range of development 
teams allowing designers to use traditional HTML and CSS editing tools, 
including WYSIWYG editors, while at the same time fitting naturally into the 
Ruby/Rails environment, leveraging layouts, partials, helpers, and the full 
power of Ruby and Rails in a natural notation. MasterView is extensible and 
includes a production-quality scaffold generator to get new projects going 
quickly.</p>
<p>Jeff Barczewski is a partner of Inspired Horizons, a software architect, 
developer, and trainer with 18 yrs of experience engineering solutions for large 
and small companies. Having much experience in developing applications the hard 
way (using C++, Java, ASP, ...), Jeff now loves to share ways to be more 
productive (using Ruby, Rails, MasterView, Open Source tools, ...) and 
ultimately enjoy life. Jeff is the founder and one of the lead developers of the 
MasterView template engine for Ruby and Rails. You can find more about Jeff at 
his website,

<h4>Carl Youngblood - Simple Bayesian Networks with Ruby</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="images/speakers/youngblood.jpg" width="200" height="196" align="left" />Bayesian networks are excellent tools for modeling knowledge, especially in realistic 
situations where there is incomplete domain awareness. Given reasonably accurate 
causal relationships between variables, a Bayesian network can determine the most 
likely state of unobserved variables in a system. Bayesian networks are used in 
a wide variety of applications, including textual analysis, image processing, consumer 
credit scoring systems, and other decision support systems. Until recently, open 
source Bayesian network libraries were not readily available, and those that have 
been released are, in this author's opinion, unnecessarily complex. The Simple Bayesian 
Networking Library (SBN) and its associated Ruby module (SBN4R) make it easy to 
harness the power of Bayesian networks in your application. This presentation will 
cover what Bayesian networks are and how they are used, as well as how to use SBN4R 
in your next Ruby application.</p>
<p>Carl Youngblood has been using Ruby since the publication of the Pickaxe book 
in 2000. He currently works as the CTO of Construction Capital Source, a construction 
lending firm with headquarters in Salt Lake City. This position is especially exciting 
for Carl, since it allows him to use Ruby all day at work. Carl received a bachelors 
degree in Portuguese from Brigham Young University and a masters degree in Computer 
Science from the University of Washington. He has been working professionally as 
a software engineer for ten years. More information about Carl can been found at

<div class="session">
<h4>Kirk Haines - IOWA</h4>
<p>IOWA is a web application for Ruby that has been in continuous<br />
development and use for almost five years for a wide variety of<br />
dynamic web sites and applications for businesses. The name is an<br />
acronym -- Internet Objects for Web Applications -- and reflects the<br />
over-arcing object based design of the framework.</p>
<p>The presentation is oriented towards the 1.0 release of IOWA, and will<br />
cover a brief history of the framework along with an architectural and<br />
feature overview. It will then present the construction of a simple<br />
application, touching on notable areas where IOWA differs from or is<br />
similar to other frameworks.</p>

<h4>The Center for Open and Sustainable Learning</h4>
<p><a href="http://cosl.usu.edu/">
<img border="0" src="images/sponsors/cosl.png" width="371" height="72" align="left" /></a> The Center 
for Open and Sustainable Learning (COSL) at Utah State University is a research, 
development, and service organization that works to increase people's access to 
educational opportunity by creating and distributing open source software and open 
educational content. Blah, blah, blah... A bunch of academic sounding jargon, right? 
COSL is a group that tries to help people get access to the education they want 
regardless of what barriers stand in their way. We write a bunch of cool open source 
software (much of which is built on Rails) that support learning literally all over 
the world (e.g., the UN University uses our software), and develop excellent open 
educational content (e.g., <a href="http://ocw.usu.edu/">http://ocw.usu.edu/</a>). 
We're looking for people interested in open source and education for employment 
or Masters and PhD work - come visit us at <a href="http://cosl.usu.edu/">http://cosl.usu.edu/</a>.</p>

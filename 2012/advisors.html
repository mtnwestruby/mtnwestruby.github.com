Mike is awesome. You should get to know him. He works for <a href="http://bloomfire.com/">Bloomfire</a> and likes to hack with Ruby. He sometimes organizes conferences like <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/">MountainWest RubyConf</a> and <a href="http://rubywebconf.org/">Ruby Web Conference</a>. Other times he'll chat with folks on the <a href="http://rubiverse.com/">Rubiverse</a> podcast. Lately he's been selling shirts at <a href="http://rubythreads.com/">Ruby Threads</a>. And talking in the third person. <a href="http://twitter.com/blowmage">twitter</a> <a href="http://github.com/blowmage">github</a> <a href="http://blowmage.com/">blog</a></p>

Brandon is a writer, Rubyist, former marketer, and general contrarian. By day, he helps make things which are awesome at Bloomfire. By night, he engages in epic lightsaber battles with his 3-year-old, poses as a snowboarder, and organizes the Utah Valley Ruby Brigade. He received his Yak Barbering license from the Stefan School of Large Mammal Cosmetology.</p>

<h3>Evan Light - <a href="http://twitter.com/elight">@elight</a></h3>

Evan Light is a test-obsessed developer. The author of several rarely useful gems, out of frustration with Cucumber, he wrote Coulda: a lightweight Given-When-Then acceptance testing DSL that sits atop Test::Unit. When he's not a talking head at conferences, he's usually working at home as a freelance developer for one or more startups, working on open source, keeping his wife and four cats company, hacking nonsensically, talking at people on the internets, and/or attempting to lose weight (or any combination of the above). What else do you do when you live 3 hours from civilization?</p>

Pat is a long time member of the Ruby and Free Software worlds, but is more likely to be hacking communities than code. A sysadmin by trade; he also enjoys cooking, reading, hiking, and speaking about himself in the third person. He rarely shoots spit wads and de vez en cuando escribe en otros idiomas. (Note, he does not speak or write Spanish.)</p>

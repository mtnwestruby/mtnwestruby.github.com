Come join us for the third annual MountainWest RubyConf 5k.
Runners and walkers of all abilities are welcome! So whether this is
part of your regular training, a New Years resolution, or just an
excuse to hang out more with Rubyists please join us.

## When

Friday, March 16, 2012 at 7:00am (before the conference starts on
Friday).

## Where

The course will be at Libery Park which is
[located at 600 E 1300 S](http://tinyurl.com/liberty-park-slc). We
will be meeting and starting at the southeast corner.  The
park has a nice woodchip trail which participants will go around twice.

Since the course is not walking distance from the conference venue we will
coordinate the rides and post-race showers for anyone who
wants to run. We will try to do this on Thursday with everyone who is
interested and use Twitter for additional organization using the
[#mwrc5k](http://twitter.com/search/%23mwrc5k) hashtag.

## Prizes

We will have prizes as we have in the past, but they will not be
awarded to the fastest runners.  Instead, we will hold a lottery at
the end of the event. All you need to do to be eligible for the
lottery is to run or walk the 5k. :)  Many thanks to
[Lead Media Partners](http://leadmediapartners.com/) for the prize
sponsorship again this year.

## How much?

It's free! However, we do need help with some of the logistics. People
need rides and showers after the event. In the past locals or people
who rent cars typically offer rides and people in hotels offer their
hotel room to shower (for locals who live far away from the event).

Again, we will try to coordinate this on Thursday before the event.

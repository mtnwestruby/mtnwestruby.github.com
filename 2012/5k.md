## Prizes

We will have prizes, but they will be awarded to participants via random drawing at the event,
rather than to the fastest runners. Many thanks to
[Lead Media Partners](http://leadmediapartners.com/) for sponsoring the 
prizes again this year!

## How much?

It's free! But people will need rides and showers after the event.

* **Locals** can offer a ride!
* **Visitors** can offer the use of hotel showers!

We'll coordinate on Thursday. If you're on Twitter, we'll be using the 
[#mwrc5k](http://twitter.com/search/%23mwrc5k) hashtag.

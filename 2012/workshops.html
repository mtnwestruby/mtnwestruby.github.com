  <h3>"Zero to Async with EventMachine and Goliath" by Gerred Dillon</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>Evented programming is all the rage lately, but actually understanding how it works and how to operate with it can lead programmers down a difficult road. This workshop will start from the very basics - how an event loop works, and build up with EventMachine. Goliath, a framework built on the marriage of EventMachine and Fibers, will be introduced. Benefits, concerns, caveats, and new ways to think about programming and interacting with users will all be covered. For the most interested in evented programming, Node.js will also be introduced as an alternative for evented programming.</p>

      Gerred Dillon (<a href="http://twitter.com/justicefries">@justicefries</a>) brings years of experience building evented systems on top of EventMachine and Node.js. He loves building products and APIs with blazingly fast I/O, and helping others realize freedom from threaded programming. He is the co-organizer of Boulder JavaScript, the organizer of Denver JavaScript, and spends almost all of his time working on asynchronous systems and data science.</p>

  <h3>"Advanced Rails Design: Use Fancy OO Techniques Without Turning Ruby into Java" by Noel Rappin</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>As Rails applications have grown and become more complex, limitations of the classic "Fat model, skinny controller" architecture have become evident. Large model classes and tight database coupling become difficult to maintain and slow to test. There have been many attempts to manage this issue. Overgeneralizing, these structures tend to add additional architecture layers that use ActiveRecord as a dumb model and use some form of dependency injection to allow for more dynamic management of object relationships.</p>

	<p>All this sounds great, but if you came to Rails precisely because it didn't have the kind of architectural overhead that more complex frameworks required then you're probably looking at these ideas with some skepticism. </p>

	<p>In this workshop, we'll show how to apply these models to your daily Rails development without burying you in a pile of complicated overhead. We'll talk about dependency injection, role or service based architecture, and how to use these to make your ongoing development life easier. We'll also cover how these techniques make it easier to write low-overhead super-fast tests to make your TDD process fly.</p>

  <h3>"Create your own CI Server status light &amp; siren workshop" by JT Zemp</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>A DIY, hands-on workshop that involves soldering, electronics assembly and coding (arduino and ruby) with the end result that each person doing the workshop leave with a hardware device that will connect to their CI server and will sound an alarm if the build fails, and give the green light if the build worked. There will be an extra fee for the kits. You'll need a laptop for onsite coding and hands (or someone else's hands) for assembly.</p>

       I'm JT (<a href="http://twitter.com/jtzemp">@jtzemp</a>). A nature geek and a geek by nature, I've been doing hardware for a little while and software dev and architecture for a longer while. Crafting cool and useful software is what brings home the bacon, and my Ruby-powered kitchen robot fries it up in a pan (don't tell my wife I called her that).</p>

  <h3>"Writing a Rails Engine" by Erik Michaels-Ober</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>As of Rails 3.2, plugins are officially deprecated. They have been replaced by Rails Engines, a class of public methods for hooking into Rails applications. This workshop will teach you how to write a Rails engine from scratch or convert your existing plugin to an engine. We will cover writing generators, migrations, configuration, mounting, and packaging your engine as a gem. We will also discuss best practices for making your engine work with other engines and when to factor your existing Rails code into an engine, for reuse across multiple applications.</p>

  <h3>"Design a Cucumber/Selenium2/Rspec Test Suite Against a Source-Ambiguous Web Application that is both Powerful and Stakeholder-Friendly" by Sam Rawlins</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>We will create a Cucumber/Selenium2/RSpec test suite against an existing, source-unavailable web app. We will quickly go over the Cucumber Scenario (Gherkin) syntax and basic Selenium2 methods. With the foundations laid, we will explore how to use "Background," data tables, "Transform," write stakeholder-friendly scenarios, deal with asynchronous activity, be unambiguous about step names, use Cucumber tags and profiles, handle ambiguously-located DOM elements, highlight elements before interacting with them, and allow for loosely-written scenarios.</p>

	<p>A Cucumber/Selenium2 beginner will hit the ground running in this workshop, which will be too much fun. /s?he/ will leave with a solid understanding of the tools, and how to design /his|her/ first Cucumber/Selenium2 test suite. A developer who has experience writing Gherkin scenarios, or experience using Selenium to drive a browser will benefit from the advanced techniques. Selenium2/WebDriver is very different from Selenium 1, and learning Selenium2 from the ground up in a workshop would be very beneficial.</p>

       Sam Rawlins (<a href="http://twitter.com/srawlins">@srawlins</a>) has been coding in Ruby for about 5 years now. He writes Ruby programs and scripts largely in the Systems world, in both work and my hobbying. He maintains several C extensions and supports them cross-platform. This talk stems from a project at his day job, where he maintains a Java web application that is tested partially with regression tests that use Cucumber, Selenium 2, and RSpec.</p>

			Caitlin Hall-West. Passion, innovation, collaboration, and integrity define Caitlin's professional and personal life. Her authenticity as a coach and consultant supports the goals and objectives designed by her clients. Always intending to expand her comfort zone and experience life outside of that zone, Caitlin worked with youth and adults as a leadership developer and advocate in state and local government, and in corporations. She then found herself intrigued by Elias Porter’s Relationship Awareness theory. She saw the potential and the results this theory provided in terms of creating stronger and more authentic relationships with self, others, team, etc. Thus she received two certifications from Personal Strengths, Inc. as a facilitator for an assessment built on Porter’s theory- Level 1 &2 Strength Deployment Inventory (SDI). She is a graduate of Accomplishment Coaching where she received 44 hours of mentor coaching and completed 212 hours of coach specific, ICF certified training.</p>
			<p>Caitlin's curiosity and joie de vivre also attracted her to joining a performance improvisational group. She finds that these unrehearsed expressions of "being" result in surprising insights into motivations and behaviors. Caitlin is engaged in unleashing the energy of this art form to help individuals and organizations make desired shifts.</p>
			<p>Caitlin’s clients consistently say how powerful and transformative she is as a coach. It’s been said that she is a superhero…she says, “Aren’t we all?”</p>

      <p class="mbm mtm">MountainWest RubyConf is open to everyone. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.</p>

      <p class="mbm">All conference participants are expected to act in a way that will foster a safe and positive conference experience for everyone during the conference and at affiliated social events. Conference participants are expected to:</p>

      <div class="list list_bullet mll mbl">
        <ul class="list__body">
          <li class="list__item">Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
          <li class="list__item">Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
          <li class="list__item">Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.</li>
          <li class="list__item">Alert conference organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.</li>
          <li class="list__item">Make new friends and have a great time.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="mbm">Unacceptable behaviors include harassing, abusive, discriminatory, or derogatory conduct. Harassment includes: offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of sexual images; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

      <p class="mbm">These behaviors will not be tolerated. If a participant behaves unacceptably, the conference organizers will take any action deemed appropriate, including involvement of local law enforcement and expulsion from the conference.</p>

      <p class="mbm">The MountainWest RubyConf team is available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement and to otherwise ensure everyone feels safe for the duration of the conference. If you or anyone else are subject to unacceptable behavior, or you have any other concerns, notify one of the conference organizers or volunteers as soon as possible.</p>

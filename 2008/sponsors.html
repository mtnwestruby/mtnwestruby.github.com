          <p><a href="http://www.ironruby.net/">IronRuby</a> is a .NET implementation of the Ruby programming language. We are building a high-quality implementation of Ruby, with excellent performance and seamless integration with .NET libraries and infrastructure. IronRuby heavily leverages Microsoft's Dynamic Language Runtime, and both are released with full source code under the Microsoft Public License. The IronRuby source code is hosted on <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ironruby">Rubyforge</a>, which is a home for open source Ruby projects. We're looking for contributions to the IronRuby libraries; our goal is to achieve parity with the Ruby standard libraries.</p>

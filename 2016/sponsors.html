          <p><a href="http://instructure.com/">Instructure, Inc.</a> makes software that makes people smarter. Founded in 2008, the company formally launched its first software-as-a-service (SaaS), the Canvas Learning Management System, in 2011. Because learning doesn’t end after graduation (and because corporate learning was begging for a revolution of its own), Instructure launched Bridge in 2015. A learning platform for corporations, Bridge delivers a compelling learning experience, which in turn, allows any workforce to grow, build expertise, and ultimately drive organizational success. Known for making teaching and learning easier through open, usable, cloud-based technologies, Instructure has connected millions of teachers and learners at more than 1,600 higher ed, K-12 and corporate institutions throughout the world.

    <p><a href="http://engineyard.com"><img border="0" src="images/sponsors/engine-yard.png" alt="Engine Yard" align="left"></a>Rely on Engine Yard: 80 people, two data centers, and four continents.</p>
    <p>Engine Yard came about in early 2006 because we saw a genuine need: customers were developing business-critical Rails apps, but they didn't want to worry about deployment issues, nor did they want to hire IT staff to manage servers. Instead, customers wanted Rails-focused 24/7 operations support, great infrastructure, and a smooth path from one to one million users.</p>
    <p>We handle deployment and maintenance, so you can focus on building your application and running your business. Our deep roots in the Ruby and Rails communities, combined with our commitment to driving the next generation of Ruby technologies, offer our customers the peace of mind of knowing their applications are managed by a team of true technical experts.</p>
    <p>Engine Yard is invested in the future of Ruby and Rails communities, and is helping foster and lead development by supporting open source projects like Merb and Rubinius.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.ironruby.net/">IronRuby</a> is a .NET implementation of the Ruby programming language. We are building a high-quality implementation of Ruby, with excellent performance and seamless integration with .NET libraries and infrastructure. IronRuby heavily leverages Microsoft's Dynamic Language Runtime, and both are released with full source code under the Microsoft Public License. The IronRuby source code is hosted on <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ironruby">Rubyforge</a>, which is a home for open source Ruby projects. We're looking for contributions to the IronRuby libraries; our goal is to achieve parity with the Ruby standard libraries.</p>

    <p>We believe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You shouldn't have to think about backup.</strong><br/>
        Backup should be set up once, and then work automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Your files should be encrypted.</strong><br/>
        Your backup files should be encrypted and stored in a secure, remote location that's only accessible to you &mdash; from anywhere.</li>
      <li><strong>Your backups should be smart.</strong><br/>
        Your backup system should be smart enough to only back up data that's not already been backed up, only back up parts of a file that have changed, and be able to back up open and locked files.</li>
    </ul>

	<p>Founded in 2005, Mozy is the world’s most trusted online backup service for consumers and small businesses with more than 1 million customers and 50,000 business customers backing up 25+ petabytes of information to multiple data centers around the globe.</p>
	<p>Mozy is owned by <a href="http://www.emc.com/">EMC Corporation</a>, a Fortune 500 company. We're headquartered in Seattle, Washington with offices in Pleasant Grove, Utah; London, England; Shanghai, China; Montreal, Canada; and Bangalore, India.</p>
	<p>We believe:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>You shouldn't have to think about backup.</strong><br/>
	    Backup should be set up once, and then work automatically.</li>
	  <li><strong>Your files should be encrypted.</strong><br/>
	    Your backup files should be encrypted and stored in a secure, remote location that's only accessible to you &mdash; from anywhere.</li>
	  <li><strong>Your backups should be smart.</strong><br/>
	    Your backup system should be smart enough to only back up data that's not already been backed up, only back up parts of a file that have changed, and be able to back up open and locked files.</li>

          Think twice, code once
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>As a teen and twenty-something programmer I often found myself tossing hundreds of lines of code at a problem. I see this pattern over and over again in the young programmers we hire at my day job. I've noticed that now that I'm in my mid thirties and have been programming for almost 20 years I spend significantly less time actually writing code even though the problems I am tasked to solve are significantly more difficult.  I recently spoke on this topic at our local ruby group and I'd like to flesh out the presentation a bit more and give it to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>The basic premise is that we should be spending significantly more time thinking than we do programming and there are wide reaching ramifications to this point.  Subtleties in how our non programming coworkers perceive some of us wandering around the office pacing or arguing at the white board are all to be covered as well as discussing the body of research that supports the ideas behind thinking more and working less. "You'll see how DevOps and Security can have a long and prosperous friendship that makes more awesome.</p>

          Code Smells: Your Refactoring Cheat Codes
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>Sure, the TDD cycle is red-green-refactor but what exactly are we refactoring? We just wrote the code, it's green, and it seems reasonable to us. Let's move onto the next test. We're have a deadline, remember?</p>

          <p>Whether we're working with code we just wrote or opening up a project for the first time, being able to listen to the hints the code is trying to give you about how it wants to be constructed is the most direct path toward successful refactoring. What the code is telling you nuanced however: no code smell is absolute and none in itself is an indication of a problem. How do we know we need to refactor? What are the code smells telling us to do? How do we balance our short terms needs of shipping our software with the long term maintainability of the code base? In this talk we'll talk through some of the classical code smells and dive into examples of how to put these smells to work for you.</p>

          Immutable Ruby
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>Most Ruby code makes heavy use of mutable state, which often contributes to long term maintenance problems. Mutability can lead to code that's difficult to understand, libraries and applications that aren't thread-safe, and tests that are slow and brittle. Immutability, on the other hand, can make code easy to reason about, safe to use in multi-threaded environments, and simple to test. Doesn't that sound nice?</p>

          <p>This talk answers the question ""why immutability?"", covers the building blocks of immutable code, such as value objects and persistent data structures, as well as higher order concepts that make heavy use of immutability, such as event sourcing and pure functions, and finally discusses the tradeoffs involved in going immutable.</p>

          Rails And Its Lovable, Demented Quirks
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>Have you ever noticed that pure Ruby codebases can be much more elegant to work with than Rails apps, over the long term? Rails provides an amazing, beautiful user experience for developers, especially at the beginning phases of a project, but that dream can turn into a nightmare when it comes time to refactor, or if you take a peek at the wrong chunk of internal logic.</p>

          <p>Classic ideas from the object-oriented design tradition can make sense of Rails internals and ease the refactoring process, but sometimes, when Rails breaks classic rules of object-oriented programming, you have to wonder how valid those rules are. Some of those rules come from Smalltalk, a language very similar to Ruby; others come from less flexible and powerful languages like Java and C++. Ruby gives you many, many opportunities to re-interpret classic OO dogma. How many of those opportunities should you take?</p>

          <p>This talk uncovers and mediates an implicit dialogue between the Rails code base and the OOP tradition. Sometimes, when the two disagree, the talk will highlight a clear winner. When no clear winner can be found, the talk will clarify the crux of the dissent. The topic is the power of Ruby.</p>

          Adventures in Paranoia with Sinatra and Sequel
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>This session is a jolly romp through the realm of practical data privacy using pure Ruby. We'll start by looking at how to obfuscate data using Ruby's OpenSSL bindings, exploring the possibilities of symmetric and public key cryptography as well as the role of hashing algorithms.</p>

          <p>Once the basic principles have been established we'll turn our attention to designing databases with a strong privacy component, using Sequel to demonstrate how encrypted keys can be used to support privacy in the relational model. There will be some meta-programming involved which should also be of interest to ActiveRecord users. This will naturally lead into a brief discussion of the seeming difficulty of searching encrypted data along with a strategy for making this practical.</p>

          <p>We'll round out the session by turning our attention to the transport layer with a simple scheme for securing web application sessions using a custom Rack middleware.</p>

          <p>The discussion will be backed by code examples inspired by real-world systems.</p>

          Component-based Architectures in Ruby and Rails 
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>It's true that goods are better distributable when they are in packages. That is the common view of what Ruby gems and Rails engines are: packages for distribution. This perception misses the great value that comes from packaging without distribution. That is what makes component-based architectures: a helpful tool for organizing growing codebases. We'll talk about how to do this with (and without) Ruby on Rails.</p>

          <p>Ruby makes it a bit hard to do packages right: you really can't hide anything. Rails doesn't want you to do it. I don't care. We'll do it anyways and it will be awesome!</p>

          <p>Reading of the CRuby source code can provide unparalleled insight into the Ruby language. During this talk we will add new native Graph data type to CRuby. The new Graph data structure will be simple but on par with other native types such as Array or Hash. This talk will demonstrate that it is easy to experiment with CRuby and extend it. We will also demonstrate the speed advantage of using C to boost Ruby performance. We will implement a few of the greatest hits of graph algorithms: Breath First Search, Dijkstra, and Minimum Spanning Tree.</p>

          Ruby off the Rails: Building a distributed system in Ruby

          <p>Devops Borat said "is turtle all way down but at bottom is perl script, but in the case of Cloud Foundry there's Ruby at the bottom.  Rails is the right choice for building a web site, but the elegance of ruby can be applied to many other things including a Platform as a Service.  A full deploy of Cloud Foundry requires many different kinds of nodes, with multiple Sinatra apps, event machine based daemons, shared ruby gems, and small amounts of code in other languages like Lua, Go and C where it makes sense.  I'd like to take you on a tour of an open source codebase and project that really shows where you can go with Ruby.</p>

        MWRC 2013 is a three day single-track conference covering Ruby and DevOps. The DevOps track will be on April 3, and the Ruby track will be April 4-5. We expect 300 attendees per day, and 350 unique attendees across all three days.</p>

      <p class="mbl">MWRC values technical excellence above all else. We are a hacker&#8217;s conference, first and foremost. We have a proven track record of attracting thought-leaders to both speak and attend. We extend opportunities for companies to influence our attendees at the conference sessions and during the official hackfest event, as well as to the community at large through the recordings available online.</p>

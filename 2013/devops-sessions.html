          Hell Has Frozen Over: DevOps &amp; Security
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>A lot of Dev and Ops people look at their security teams with disdain: "Those guys are arseholes. All they ever do is sit in meetings and tell us no." They know there's no way Security will ever embrace DevOps. In turn many security folks see the emergence of DevOps as the inmates being put in charge of the asylum. It'll all end in chaos and disaster.</p>

          <p>So who's right? Can DevOps and security co-exist? Can they be friends?  We will take a deeper look at:</p>

          <ul class="list list_bullet">
            <li class="list__item">What DevOps means for Security</li>
            <li class="list__item">How DevOps can be sold to Security</li>

            <li class="list__item">How those Security folks might know some things that could make DevOps better</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You'll see how DevOps and Security can have a long and prosperous friendship that makes more awesome.</p>

          Boxen: How to Manage an Army of Laptops and Live to Talk About It
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>At GitHub, we've been growing pretty quickly and that sort of growth presents a lot of challenges. We were feeling the pain of trying to teach everyone (developers and designers alike) how to get GitHub and all our other projects running on their laptops. The process was failure-prone, complex, and time-consuming. So, last summer, we created the first iteration of The Setup — GitHub's method of managing laptops without getting all authoritarian about it. We quickly realized that other organizations needed and wanted this environment, so we started back with the basics and re-architected The Setup into Boxen. The same tool, the same method, but written for modularity and general consumption.</p>

          <p>We’ve since released Boxen (as of January 2013) and other organizations are using it to great success. This talk explores our design choices with Boxen, how we use Boxen internally, our recommended design patterns for managing Boxen-driven automation, and some new goodies coming down the pipeline for Boxen.</p>

          Escalating complexity: DevOps learnings from Air France 447
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>On June 1, 2009 Air France 447 crashed into the Atlantic ocean killing all 228 passengers and crew. The 15 minutes leading up to the impact were a terrifying demonstration of the how thick the fog of war is in complex systems.</p>

          <p>Mainstream reports of the incident put the blame on the pilots - a common motif in incident reports that conveniently ignore a simple fact: people were just actors within a complex system, doing their best based on the information at hand. </p>

          <p>While the systems you build and operate likely don't control the fate of people's lives, they share many of the same complexity characteristics. Dev and Ops can learn an abundance from how the feedback loops between these aviation systems are designed and how these systems are operated.</p>

          <p>In this talk Lindsay will cover what happened on the flight, why the mainstream explanation doesn't add up, how design assumptions can impact people's ability to respond to rapidly developing situations, and how to improve your operational effectiveness when dealing with rapidly developing failure scenarios.</p>

          <p>Chargify.com's customers rely on us to process payments for them 24 hours a day. We do not have any planned maintenance windows: we're simply expected to be up all the time. We recently migrated from a private datacenter to EC2, moving all our operations and data across the country with zero downtime. All thanks to a combination of highly-automated configuration with Chef and specialized DB tools like Tungsten.</p>
          <p>You'll learn about our pain points in planning the switchover, like:</p>

          <ul class="list list_bullet">

          </ul>

          <p>
            And most importantly, how we addressed every one! I'll demonstrate how we rebuilt our entire infrastructure platform from the ground up: New system images with all new cookbooks that were deployed into our existing operation without any interruption. Finally, I'll discuss testing our stack and how we replicate it among various environments and plan for future expansion.

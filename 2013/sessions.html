          Why We Need DevOps Now: A Fourteen Year Study Of High Performing IT Organizations
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>Gene Kim will present his findings from an ongoing study of how high-performing IT organizations simultaneously deliver stellar service levels and deliver fast flow of new features into the production environment. To successfully deliver against what on the surface appear to be conflicting objectives, (i.e. preserving service levels while introducing significant amounts of change into production), requires creating a highly-coordinated collection of teams where Development, QA, IT Operations, as well as Product Management and Information Security genuinely work together to solve business objectives.</p>

          <p>Gene will describe what successful transformations look like, and how those transformations were achieved from a software development and service operations perspective. He will draw upon fourteen years of research of high-performing IT organizations, as well as work he's done since 2008 to help some of the largest Internet companies increase feature flow and production stability through applications of DevOps principles.</p>

        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>A lot of Dev and Ops people look at their security teams with disdain: "Those guys are arseholes. All they ever do is sit in meetings and tell us no." They know there's no way Security will ever embrace DevOps. In turn many security folks see the emergence of DevOps as the inmates being put in charge of the asylum. It'll all end in chaos and disaster.</p>

          <p>So who's right? Can DevOps and security co-exist? Can they be friends?  We will take a deeper look at:</p>

          <ul class="list list_bullet">

            <li class="list__item">How those Security folks might know some things that could make DevOps better</li>

          Boxen: How to Manage an Army of Laptops and Live to Talk About It
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>At GitHub, we've been growing pretty quickly and that sort of growth presents a lot of challenges. We were feeling the pain of trying to teach everyone (developers and designers alike) how to get GitHub and all our other projects running on their laptops. The process was failure-prone, complex, and time-consuming. So, last summer, we created the first iteration of The Setup — GitHub's method of managing laptops without getting all authoritarian about it. We quickly realized that other organizations needed and wanted this environment, so we started back with the basics and re-architected The Setup into Boxen. The same tool, the same method, but written for modularity and general consumption.</p>

          <p>We’ve since released Boxen (as of January 2013) and other organizations are using it to great success. This talk explores our design choices with Boxen, how we use Boxen internally, our recommended design patterns for managing Boxen-driven automation, and some new goodies coming down the pipeline for Boxen.</p>

          <p>One of the reasons for the DevOps movement is that all developers should carry pagers and be on call, right?</p>

          <p>Well, not quite. However, there is a common area of conflict between operations and development teams about site outages related to application-related issues that developers know how to debug and fix much faster than operations typically does.</p>

          Escalating complexity: DevOps learnings from Air France 447
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>On June 1, 2009 Air France 447 crashed into the Atlantic ocean killing all 228 passengers and crew. The 15 minutes leading up to the impact were a terrifying demonstration of the how thick the fog of war is in complex systems.</p>

          <p>Mainstream reports of the incident put the blame on the pilots - a common motif in incident reports that conveniently ignore a simple fact: people were just actors within a complex system, doing their best based on the information at hand. </p>

          <p>While the systems you build and operate likely don't control the fate of people's lives, they share many of the same complexity characteristics. Dev and Ops can learn an abundance from how the feedback loops between these aviation systems are designed and how these systems are operated.</p>

          <p>In this talk Lindsay will cover what happened on the flight, why the mainstream explanation doesn't add up, how design assumptions can impact people's ability to respond to rapidly developing situations, and how to improve your operational effectiveness when dealing with rapidly developing failure scenarios.</p>

          Think twice, code once
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>As a teen and twenty-something programmer I often found myself tossing hundreds of lines of code at a problem. I see this pattern over and over again in the young programmers we hire at my day job. I've noticed that now that I'm in my mid thirties and have been programming for almost 20 years I spend significantly less time actually writing code even though the problems I am tasked to solve are significantly more difficult.  I recently spoke on this topic at our local ruby group and I'd like to flesh out the presentation a bit more and give it to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>The basic premise is that we should be spending significantly more time thinking than we do programming and there are wide reaching ramifications to this point.  Subtleties in how our non programming coworkers perceive some of us wandering around the office pacing or arguing at the white board are all to be covered as well as discussing the body of research that supports the ideas behind thinking more and working less.</p>

          Code Smells: Your Refactoring Cheat Codes
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>Sure, the TDD cycle is red-green-refactor but what exactly are we refactoring? We just wrote the code, it's green, and it seems reasonable to us. Let's move onto the next test. We're have a deadline, remember?</p>

          <p>Whether we're working with code we just wrote or opening up a project for the first time, being able to listen to the hints the code is trying to give you about how it wants to be constructed is the most direct path toward successful refactoring. What the code is telling you nuanced however: no code smell is absolute and none in itself is an indication of a problem. How do we know we need to refactor? What are the code smells telling us to do? How do we balance our short terms needs of shipping our software with the long term maintainability of the code base? In this talk we'll talk through some of the classical code smells and dive into examples of how to put these smells to work for you.</p>

          Immutable Ruby
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>Most Ruby code makes heavy use of mutable state, which often contributes to long term maintenance problems. Mutability can lead to code that's difficult to understand, libraries and applications that aren't thread-safe, and tests that are slow and brittle. Immutability, on the other hand, can make code easy to reason about, safe to use in multi-threaded environments, and simple to test. Doesn't that sound nice?</p>

          <p>This talk answers the question ""why immutability?"", covers the building blocks of immutable code, such as value objects and persistent data structures, as well as higher order concepts that make heavy use of immutability, such as event sourcing and pure functions, and finally discusses the tradeoffs involved in going immutable.</p>

          Pounding Simplicity into Wiki
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>I wrote the first wiki in a week. Why has it taken me a year to write another? Short answer: when something is already surprisingly simple its hard to make it simpler.</p>

          <p>This last year I set out to do for numbers what I had done for words, give them depth and meaning that ordinary people can depend on every day. A wiki, like a glossary, defines the terms we choose to use. A data-wiki makes those choices more complex. Its no longer one click to check a definition. Its more like one more study to check a dataset, to see if the data says what we think it does. Not a simple process.</p>

          <p>My quest has been to make knowing and using data an everyday thing. This means the study of data must be an everyday thing too. To this end I've pushed visualization, I've pushed domain specific markups, I've pushed streaming measurements. But through this I've retained wiki's greatest strength: the ability to create with those who we have just met and don't yet have reason to trust. Finding trust on the modern web may be this year's biggest accomplishment.</p>

I'll revisit my "walled garden" concept and study strategies of several other communities to boil them down to their core essence. From this I've developed a meta-troll set of rules to help identify the type of troll you're dealing with so you can most effectively deal with them. So...

        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>Whether your application is concurrent or not, there's insight to be gained from Ruby's threading support.</p>

          <p>This talk demonstrates building a light-weight sampling profiler in pure Ruby. The techniques are simple enough to integrate into almost any application, and fast enough for even a production environment. If you've ever wondered exactly what your application is doing at any given moment, this will show you how to find out.</p>

          <p>Along the way we'll expose gotchas and pitfalls of thread introspection on the many versions and implementations of Ruby. Based on experience implementing thread profiling for New Relic, we'll also touch on how to debug and work around problems when they come up</p>

          Adventures in Paranoia with Sinatra and Sequel
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>This session is a jolly romp through the realm of practical data privacy using pure Ruby. We'll start by looking at how to obfuscate data using Ruby's OpenSSL bindings, exploring the possibilities of symmetric and public key cryptography as well as the role of hashing algorithms.</p>

          <p>Once the basic principles have been established we'll turn our attention to designing databases with a strong privacy component, using Sequel to demonstrate how encrypted keys can be used to support privacy in the relational model. There will be some meta-programming involved which should also be of interest to ActiveRecord users. This will naturally lead into a brief discussion of the seeming difficulty of searching encrypted data along with a strategy for making this practical.</p>

          <p>We'll round out the session by turning our attention to the transport layer with a simple scheme for securing web application sessions using a custom Rack middleware.</p>

          <p>The discussion will be backed by code examples inspired by real-world systems.</p>

          Component-based Architectures in Ruby and Rails 
        </h2>
        <section class="media_speaker__description">
          <p>It's true that goods are better distributable when they are in packages. That is the common view of what Ruby gems and Rails engines are: packages for distribution. This perception misses the great value that comes from packaging without distribution. That is what makes component-based architectures: a helpful tool for organizing growing codebases. We'll talk about how to do this with (and without) Ruby on Rails.</p>

          <p>Ruby makes it a bit hard to do packages right: you really can't hide anything. Rails doesn't want you to do it. I don't care. We'll do it anyways and it will be awesome!</p>

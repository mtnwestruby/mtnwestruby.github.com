Amazing! All Ruby tickets are sold out in just 6 days. We don't know if that is some sort of regional conference record, but it should be.

Good news is that you can still [register for the DevOps sessions](https://mwrc.wufoo.com/forms/mwrc-2013-registration/). Unfortunately, the only Ruby session tickets left are for [sponsors](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2013/prospectus) and [scholarship awardees](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2013/scholarships).

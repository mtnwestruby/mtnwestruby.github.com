We're trying out a new program this year: "Stay with a Local". If there's interest, we'll have volunteers host MWRC attendees, so you can stay with local Rubyists rather than at a hotel. 

[Contact @mwrc on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/mwrc) or email the program's facilitator (brandonhays \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com) to let us know you're interested, and we'll do our best to find a place for anyone who wants one.

Of course, we'll pre-screen all hosts to ensure they're not serial killers or Rebecca Black fans.

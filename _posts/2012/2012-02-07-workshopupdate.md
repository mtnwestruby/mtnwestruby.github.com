Each year, it seems MWRC sells out a bit faster, and 2012 is no exception. We're currently about two-thirds full already, on pace to start turning people away earlier than we had to last year.

We really want you here, but we also choose a venue that keeps the conference relatively small and intimate. That means that you'll need to move *muy rapido* to ensure you have a spot!

The [Saturday workshops](/2012/workshops) are extremely limited, and are fast becoming unavailable. The OOP in Ruby workshop is already overbooked and no longer available, and the others are filling up quickly.

Your best bet is to [register now](/2012/register).  We've never been more excited for a lineup of [speakers](/2012/sessions) than we are in 2012, and the stage is set for a conference packed with insight and fun.

We're so psyched about the caliber of speakers, workshop instructors, and attendees coming together this year. Let us reiterate: **we want you here.** So please [register now](/2012/register) and don't miss out!

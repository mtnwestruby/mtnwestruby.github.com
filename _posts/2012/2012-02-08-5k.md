By popular demand (quite literally), the [MWRC 5K](/2012/5k) is back for a third year! 

It's a fantastic time to get outside with some Rubyists, enjoy some mountain air, and if the past two years were any indication, show off your Vibram Five Fingers.

Thanks to our friends at Lead Media Partners, there will be prizes, and they'll be given via random drawing rather than just to the fastest runners. Because if you can drag yourself out of bed early enough to run a 5K during a conference, you've already won.

You can find all the details and register on [the 5K page](/2012/5k). 

Whether you're trying to fulfill your New Year's resolution or you're looking for an excuse to get outdoors, we think you'll find the 5K to be one of the most fun and memorable parts of MWRC.

Even if you're not a runner, it's worth waking up to come run (or walk) around a lake in Utah at sunrise with super cool Rubyists from around the country. Seriously, how awesome is that?

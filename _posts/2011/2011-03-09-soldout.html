We are sold out! Well, we are more than sold out. We oversold by 10%, which means we are absolutely, positively, completely full. Registration is now closed, for reals this time. However, there are still some spaces for the <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2011/training">training on March 16th</a>. A full day of professional training for $75 is a killer deal.</p>

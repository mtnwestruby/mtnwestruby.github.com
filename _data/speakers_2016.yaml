  title: How to Build a Skyscraper
  description: "Since 1884, humans have been building skyscrapers. This means that
    we had 6 decades of skyscraper-building experience before we started building
    software (depending on your definition of \"software\"). Maybe there are some
    lessons we can learn from past experience?\n\nThis talk won't make you an expert
    skyscraper-builder, but you might just come away with a different perspective
    on how you build software."
  biography: Ernie Miller has never built a skyscraper. He has been building software
    since he was six years old, though, and he's reportedly built some pretty awesome
    pillow forts in his day.

  title: "Sharpening The Axe: Self-Teaching For Developers"
  description: "Many of us get a few years into our career and get stuck in a rut.
    Maybe we stop reading about the latest and greatest in tech. Maybe we start managing
    and do less coding than we'd like. Maybe life gets in the way and coding becomes
    drudgery.\n\nOne way to combat this feeling is to focus on learning. I'll
    share what I've learned about juggling self improvement with being a professional
    nerd. I'll talk about the courses, tools, books, and other resources I've found
    most useful. You’ll leave this talk with several ideas for breaking out of your
    own developer rut."
  biography: "Aja lives in Seattle where she is a Developer Advocate at Google and
    a member of the Seattle Ruby Brigade. Her favorite languages are Ruby and
    Prolog. She also loves working with large piles of data. In her free time she
    enjoys skiing, cooking, knitting, and long coding sessions on the beach."

  title: Writing a Test Framework from Scratch
  description: "Assertions (or expectations) are the most important part of any test
    framework. How are they written? What happens when one fails? How does a test
    communicate its results? Past talks have shown how test frameworks work from the
    very top: how they find, load, select, and run tests. Instead of reading code
    from the top, we’ll write code from scratch starting with assertions and building
    up a full test framework. By the end, you'll know how every square inch of your
    testing framework works."
  biography: Ryan Davis has been using Ruby since 2000 and is a founding member of
    the Seattle Ruby Brigade, the first and foremost ruby brigade in the world. His
    background includes QA, automation, language and tool development, object databases,
    and smalltalk. In ruby/rails, he has focused on developer productivity, code/process/people
    optimization, and test automation tools such as heckle, hoe, ruby_parser, ruby2c,
    ruby2ruby, RubyInline, ZenTest, minitest, and more.

  title: "Security is Broken: Understanding Common Vulnerabilities"
  description: The Internet is built on technology that was never meant to work together.
    Basic features in seemingly simple and innocuous technologies, such as XML, resulted
    in these technologies being insecure. In this session we’ll talk about how attackers
    exploit well known vulnerabilities like XSS, XXE, and CSRF and how to make more
    secure software by avoiding similar decisions that resulted in these exploits.
  biography: Eileen M. Uchitelle is a programmer on Basecamp’s Security, Infrastructure,
    and Performance team. Eileen is an ardent contributor to open source, focusing
    most of her energy on improving performance and security in Rails. When taking
    a break from the excitement of refactoring source code, Eileen enjoys craft beer
    and hiking in the Hudson Valley with her husband and their dog.

  title: How are method calls formed?
  description: "In this presentation we're going to study how method calls are executed.  We'll
    go from bytecode created by Ruby's Virtual Machine down to the C code where the
    methods actually get executed.  After we've learned about how Ruby executes methods
    today, we'll dive in to optimizations we can make on method dispatch including
    various types of inline method caching.  Audience members should leave with a
    better understanding of Ruby's VM internals as well as ways to analyze and optimize
    their own code."
  biography: Aaron Patterson is on the Ruby Core team, and the Rails Core team. He
    likes puns, cats, programming, and trying to find the intersection of all these
    interests. Aaron is currently working at Red Hat on a team dedicated to turning
    clouds in to smiles.

  title: The Minimum Viable Conference
  description: "Ok, so, if nothing else, we've got one thing in common. We like conferences.
    The two of us like 'em so much that we recently spent a large chunk of time and
    money organizing and hosting one, and are planning at least one more for next
    year, too. Ask us about it!\n\nWe're here to spill the beans on what it takes
    to make these things happen. We'll do our damndest to tell you everything you
    need to know to get your own conference off the ground. We'll cover topics like:\n\n-
    How many people do you need? To attend? To organize?\n- Where's the money come
    from?\n- How do you get sponsors?\n- How do you run a CFP?\n- What are the
    easy wins and hard losses?\n- For what services do you pay versus those you
    seek for free?\n- How do you protect yourself and your fellow organizers?\n-
    Who buys the beer?\n\nWhether you're planning a multi-day conference, a monthly
    meetup, or just a one-time get-together for your office, we'll give you a handy
    list of DOs and DONTs, based on our own experiences and those of others in the
    community event game. Like Kerri's Gramma once said, \"If you want to go to a
    party, sometimes you have to throw it yourself.\""
  biography: Kerri Miller is a Software Developer and Team Lead based in the Pacific
    Northwest. She has worked at enterprise companies, international ad agencies,
    boutique consultancies, start-ups, mentors and teaches students, and finds time

  title: Surviving the Framework Hype Cycle
  description: Baskin Robbins wishes it had as many flavors as there are JS frameworks,
    build tools, and cool new "low-level" languages. You just want to solve a problem,
    not have a 500-framework bake-off! And how will you know whether you picked the
    right one? Don't flip that table, because we'll use the "hype cycle" and the history
    of Ruby and Rails as a guide to help you understand which front-end and back-end
    technologies are a fit for your needs, wants, and career now and in the future.
  biography: Brandon Hays left the world of marketing to find that creating software
    made him happy. Brandon lives in Austin, TX, where he helps run The Frontside,
    a consultancy specializing in Ember.js. Brandon's lifelong mission to to hug every

  title: Orders of Magnitude
  description: "Up until the 17th century, the world was mostly limited to what we
    could see with the naked eye. Our understanding of things much smaller and much
    larger than us was limited. In the past 400 years our worldview has increased
    enormously, which has led to the advent of technology, space exploration, computers
    and the internet. However, our brains are ill equipped to handle dealing with
    numbers at these scales, and attempt to trick us at every turn.\n\nSoftware
    engineers deal with computers every day, and thus we are subject to both incredibly
    tiny and massively large numbers all the time. Learn about how your brain is fooling
    you when you are dealing with issues of latency, scalability, and algorithm optimization,
    so that you can become a better programmer."
  biography: Davy is an Engineering Manager at GitHub, working on the team focused
    on the scalability and availability of the GitHub application. She lives in Portland,
    Oregon, where she enjoys skiing, gardening, knitting, twittering, drinking all
    the fantastic beer that Portland has to provide, and ignoring her cats as much
    as they ignore her.

  title: "TDD For Your Soul: Virtue through Software Development"
  description: Web development pushes us to our limits, not only of cognition, but,
    perhaps surprisingly, of character. Using the cardinal virtues as a framework,
    we can see that developers need courage to learn, temperance to prioritize goals,
    a sense of justice by which to discern obligations, and wisdom to choose our path.
    By being honest about where we lack virtue, and implementing steps to develop
    character, we can perform test-driven development on ourselves. This process can
    help us grow not only as developers, but as human beings.
  biography: Abraham’s first taste of programming was writing violent choose-your-own-adventure
    games in TI-BASIC on his graphing calculator instead of paying attention during
    algebra class. Now he develops software at Avant. He studied the virtuous life
    in graduate school but has still failed to obtain it.

  description: Burnout is the professional's palsy. It leaves you paralyzed, unable
    to do what you need to do, and it strikes without warning. Or does it? Through
    story, metaphor, and perhaps even code sample, let's take a look at how to recognize,
    prepare for, and weather burnout, and hopefully come through the other side stronger
    than ever!
  biography: I write software, I've been (severely) burned by burnout, and yet I've
    managed to come through the other side.

  title: Ruby Is For Fun and Robots
  description: Most of us use ruby for work, but do we still use it for fun? Is maximizing
    your webscale for optimal synergy getting you down? Let's talk about something
    fun you can do with ruby and robots instead.
  biography: Michael helps to organize the UV.rb chapter of Utah Ruby Users Groups.
    He has three young sons and a "bajillion" legos that he builds with them. He currently
    works at MX.

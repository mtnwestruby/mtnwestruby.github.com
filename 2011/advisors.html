Mike is awesome. You should get to know him. He works for <a href="http://atti.com/">AT&amp;T Interactive</a> and likes to hack with Ruby. He sometimes organizes conferences like <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/">MountainWest RubyConf</a> and <a href="http://rubywebconf.org/">Ruby|Web Conference</a>. Other times he'll chat with folks on the <a href="http://rubiverse.com/">Rubiverse</a> podcast. Lately he's been selling shirts at <a href="http://rubythreads.com/">Ruby Threads</a>. And talking in the third person. <a href="http://twitter.com/blowmage">twitter</a> <a href="http://github.com/blowmage">github</a> <a href="http://blowmage.com/">blog</a></p>

Ben has been working with Ruby professionally since 2005. He currently works at a startup called <a href="http://leadtune.com">LeadTune</a> where he wears multiple hats ranging from developer, data scientist, dev-op, and tester. He has contributed to and started various open source projects (notably Cucumber and RSpec). You can find Ben as 'bmabey' on <a href="http://github.com/bmabey">github</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/bmabey">twitter</a>. While not coding Ben can often be found running barefoot through the neighborhoods and surrounding mountains of Salt Lake City.</p>

Evan Light is a test-obsessed developer. The author of several rarely useful gems, out of frustration with Cucumber, he wrote Coulda: a lightweight Given-When-Then acceptance testing DSL that sits atop Test::Unit. When he's not a talking head at conferences, he's usually working at home as a freelance developer for one or more startups, working on open source, keeping his wife and four cats company, hacking nonsensically, talking at people on the internets, and/or attempting to lose weight (or any combination of the above). What else do you do when you live 3 hours from civilization?</p>

Pat is a long time member of the Ruby and Free Software worlds, but is more likely to be hacking communities than code. A sysadmin by trade; he also enjoys cooking, reading, hiking, and speaking about himself in the third person. He rarely shoots spit wads and de vez en cuando escribe en otros idiomas. (Note, he does not speak or write Spanish.)</p>

Jake learned about Ruby in 2005 but didn't decide to sell his bed of nails until 2007. He coordinates the Salt Lake City Ruby users group and currently can be found developing a family information system for <a href="http://aboutone.com/">aboutone.com</a>. He spends most of his free time playing legos, army men and throwing tea parties with his 3 sons and daughter.</p>

I discovered Ruby in 2007. Quickly thereafter, I raised my PHP contracting rates by 3x. Although I enjoy other languages, JavaScript and Clojure come to mind, Ruby remains my weapon of choice for most tasks I tackle during my adventures at <a href="http://leadtune.com/">LeadTune</a>. Other things about me: I'm Git evangelist, involved open source community member, family man, Christian, and musician.

<h3>Kay Johansen - <a href="http://twitter.com/utahkay">@utahkay</a></h3>

Kay has been asked to write this bio about herself in the third person. Kay loves Ruby but otherwise has no claim to be part of the Ruby community. When she's not riding horses, she likes to crash conferences. She's hoping to bottle some of the joy and energy from the MWRC and sell it at Agile conferences, to support her long-standing Extreme Programming and Crystal habit. She hangs out with the other junkies at the Salt Lake Agile user group.</p>

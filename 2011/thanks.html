<p>Thank you for registering for MountainWest RubyConf 2011!</p>
<p>You should seriously consider attending the <a href="/2011/training">Training Day</a> being presented by our Gold Sponsor, Obtiva. Training Day will be held the day before MWRC, on Wednesday, March 16 at the nearby Hilton. It includes the courses "Improve Your Ruby Skills" and "Get Started With TDD in a Legacy Environment" and is taught by <a href="http://railsrx.com/">Noel Rappin</a>, author of the upcoming <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/nrtest/rails-test-prescriptions">Rails Test Prescriptions</a> book. But best of all its just $75! The training is limited to just 60 attendees, so <a href="https://obtiva.eventwax.com/mountain-west-ruby-conf-training-day/register">register now!</a></p>

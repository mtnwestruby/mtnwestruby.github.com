  <section class="description">
    <p>Your entire nervous systems literally wired to be reprogrammed. Are you working with its strengths? Do you know how to tell if you're not? In this session we'll explore some exciting discoveries in neuroscience and psychology, and then immediately put this knowledge to use creating iterative change inside our brains. Or maybe we'll just monkeypatch some stuff and see what happens. If you want to start or break new habit instantly, start unit testing your own behavior, or if you just think it would be fun to know how to hack a debug breakpoint into somebody else's brain, this talk is for you!</p>

  <h3>"Confessions of a Data Junkie: Fetching, Parsing, and Visualization" by Bobby Wilson</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>This is not a scientific talk. It's a survey of each step in my process of creating something meaningful out of a pile of data. The talk will be a blend of anecdotes, process, data sources, tools available, and good ol' hacks. We live in a world filled with recorded data. Lots of that data is online, and retrievable in some fashion. Unfortunately, that data is often sparse, poorly labeled, and uninsured. Enter Ruby, with a wide variety of gems and libraries to help us trudge through funky data, store it, sort it out, and spit shine it for the masses.</p>

  <h3>"fog or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cloud" by Wesley Beary</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>Cloud computing scared the crap out of me - the quirks and nightmares of provisioning cloud computing, dns, storage, ... on AWS, Terremark, Rackspace, ... - I mean, where do you even start?</p>
 	<p>Since I couldn't find a good answer, I undertook the (probably insane) task of creating one. fog (http://github.com/geemus/fog) gives you a place to start by creating abstractions that work across many different providers, greatly reducing the barrier to entry (and the cost of switching later). The abstractions are built on top of solid wrappers for each api. So if the high level stuff doesn't cut it you can dig in and get the job done. On top of that, mocks are available to simulate what clouds will do for development and testing (saving you time and money).</p>
 	<p>You'll get a whirlwind tour of basic through advanced as we create the building blocks of a highly distributed (multi-cloud) system with some simple Ruby scripts that work nearly verbatim from provider to provider. Get your feet wet working with cloud resources or just make it easier on yourself as your usage gets more complex, either way fog makes it easy to get what you need from the cloud.</p>

  <h3>"Behind the Keys: Redis Oyster Cult" by Nick Quaranto</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>Redis is an "advanced key-value store" but really, it's much more than that. Redis goes above and beyond GET and SET, and it's time for you to learn how that can help you write faster Ruby apps. We'll explore the rest that Redis has to offer, such as sorted sets, publish/subscribe, transactions, and more with real-world use cases of each.

  <h3>"SOA and the Monolithic Rails App Anti-Pattern" by Chris Wyckoff</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>Ruby on Rails is a wonderful framework that makes creating websites simple and fun. But, perhaps because it is a pleasure to work with, Rails can be overused. A simple CRUD application can quickly become a behemoth, it's responsibilities encompassing far more functionality than one application should. In the startup world, one such app can run an entire business.</p>
 	<p>Monolithic Rails applications are an anti-pattern that hamper productivity, increase bugs, and, if you are a startup, can threaten your business. How do you fix the problem?  Decompose your application into several independent, reusable services. This talk relates my experience leading a team of developers who re-architected a monolithic Rails app -- an app that effectively was the business -- into a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Using targeted code examples, it seeks to describe not only the advantages of a service-oriented approach, but also techniques for refactoring a production application into a more distributed architecture without destroying the business in the process. Finally, this talk highlights some common SOA pitfalls and describes effective ways to avoid or remedy them. Attendees will walk away with a clear demonstration of how to refactor or think about building their app with SOA in mind.</p>

  <h3>"Service Oriented Design in Practice" by Bryan Helmkamp</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>Implementing a Service Oriented Design with Ruby can lower maintenance costs by increasing isolation, scalability and code reuse. That's the theory, anyway. It's true, but in practice there are lots of nitty gritty details of rolling out a service oriented design that can reduce the expected benefits -- or even leave you worse off than you started.</p>
 	<p>This talk will shed light on what it takes to successfully leverage a service oriented architecture. Emphasis will be on less discussed considerations like testing strategies, dependency and release management, operations and developer tools rather than the happy path of how to implement and consume services. Examples will be provided from our experience building tool to analyze home energy use in order to help people save on their power bills.</p>
 	<p>In the end, you'll walk away with a deeper understanding of how to weigh the pros and cons of introducing services into your architecture, and you'll have learned some techniques to make the transition smoother if you decide it's right for you.</p>

  <h3>"Securing Your Rails App" by Jim Weirich and Matt Yoho</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <blockquote>Then it starts to scan the computer and transmit bits of information every time he clicks the mouse while he's surfing. After a while, [...] we've accumulated a complete mirror image of the content of his hard drive [...]. And then it's time for the hostile takeover.</blockquote>
 	<p>-- Lisbeth Salander in Stieg Larsson's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"</p>
 	<p>Hacker dramas like the Stieg Larrson book make for good fiction, but we know that real life rarely matches drama. And with all the security features that Rails 3 has added, surely it is difficult to hack a typical Rails web site.</p>
 	<p>Right?</p>
 	<p>Wrong!  Without deliberate attention to the details of security, it almost certain that your site has flaws that a knowledgeable hacker can exploit. This talk will cover the ins and outs of web security and help you build a site that is protected from the real Lisbeth Salanders of the world.</p>

  <h3>"Ruby Supercomputing: Using The GPU For Massive Performance Speedup" by Preston Lee</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>Applications typically measure processing throughput as a function of CPU-bound algorithm performance. Most modern production systems will contain 2-16 processor cores, but highly concurrent, compute-heavy algorithms may still reach hard limits. Within recent years, vendors such as Nvidia and Apple have formalized specifications and APIs that allow every developer to run potentially 1,000s of concurrent threads using a piece of hardware already present in the machine: the GPU.</p>

  <h3>"Modeling concurrency in Ruby and beyond" by Ilya Grigorik</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>The world of concurrent computation is a complicated one. We have to think about the hardware, the runtime, and even choose between half a dozen different models and primitives: fork/wait, threads, shared memory, message passing, semaphores, and transactions just to name a few. And that's only the beginning.</p>
 	<p>What's the state of the art for dealing with concurrency &amp; parallelism in Ruby? We'll take a quick look at the available runtimes, what they offer, and their limitations. Then, we'll dive into the concurrency models and ask are threads really the best we can do to design, model, and test our software? What are the alternatives, and is Ruby the right language to tackle these problems?</p>
 	<p>Spoiler: out with the threads. Seriously.</p>

  <h3>"The State of C Extensions: Alive and Well, so Learn to Deal" by Sam Rawlins</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>Ruby C Extensions have been a roller coaster ride over the last few years. While many Rubyists shy away from such non-Ruby code, its hard to imagine our Ruby ecosystem without them. Many of the most popular gems are C extensions. They are thriving today, and can play nice everywhere that Ruby plays nice! C extensions are not a drag on the community, but instead an exciting path that exposes Ruby to a greater computing landscape.</p>
 	<p>This talk aims to diffuse a lot of rumors about Ruby C extensions. They are not an obscure relic from the yesteryear; C extensions are actively being developed today, and solve real world problems for the Ruby community. C extensions do work with alternative Ruby interpreters/VMs; Rubinius, MacRuby, REE, and JRuby have full support for C extensions. Finally, C extensions _do_ work on Windows. (Side note: many Rubyists don't know that Ruby runs on Windows. It does.) The Windows RubyInstaller and RakeCompiler projects have come far, and work to provide Windows Rubyists with fully-functioning C extension gems.</p>
 	<p>We'll address rumors surrounding C extensions, and explore how C developers can find a home with the friendliest programming community out there: Rubyists!</p>

  <h3>"Tiny Tools Tidy Tests" by Evan Light</h3>
  <section class="description">
    <p>I admit it. I like my code to read like English when possible. I am not unique in that regard. But, at least as importantly, I like my tools to be tractable;  I'm unhappy if a quick trip to a gem's /lib results in confusion and frustration. If I can't understand my tools, I can't extend them. I can't truly make them *my* tools.</p>
 	<p>In this regard, it is possible to have your cake and eat it too.</p>
 	<p>Because I, and many Rubyists, are test-obsessed, this talk will focus on testing tools. We'll discuss lesser known gems (in many senses of the word) that build on Test::Unit. Yes, we will compare them to the twin juggernauts of RSpec and Cucumber. Finally, if none of the existing tools quite scratch your itch, we will discsus how you can build tools that meet your particular needs without resorting to "Swiss Army Knife" tools.</p>
 	<p>By the end of this talk, you will develop an appreciation for tiny tools, some sympathy for Test::Unit, reach enlightenment, add a schizophrenic/demonic voice to your mind constantly asking you "why are you using THAT?", save a kitten, and just maybe learn a few things to change your testing practices for the better.</p>

	<p>Due to overwhelming demand we have to close registration. We are 10% oversold. We literally can't hold anymore people. There are still some spaces for the training on March 16th. Its a screaming deal at just $75 for a full day of premium training.</p>
	<p>Still want to go to a conference? Then you should seriously consider <a href="http://ruby.onales.com/">Ruby on Ales</a> in Bend, Oregon the weekend after MWRC. They have an amazing lineup of speakers. Its the next best thing to being at MWRC!</p>

The second annual MWRC 5K will be held on Friday morning at Liberty Park. This is a free fun run and prizes (TBD) will be awarded to the winners. We will meet at 7:00 AM at the southeast corner of the park and the gun will fire shortly after. You may register for the race on Thursday at the conference or the morning of the race.

We will coordinate the rides and post-race showers for anyone who wants to run[1]. We will try to do this on Thursday with everyone who is interested and use [this Facebook discussion] and Twitter for additional organization using the [\#mwrc5k] hashtag.

[1] Locals or people who rent cars typically offer rides and people in hotels offer their hotel room to shower (for locals who live far away from the event).
